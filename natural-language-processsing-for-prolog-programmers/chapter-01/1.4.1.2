Nominally, the answer should be 'no' as the phonology of English is different from French but in should be rare in practice to create one speach synthesizer for a language without sharing data/training between backends. Most architectures train on shared data and create a specialized synthesizer for a single language as this is much more efficient than creating specialized synthesizers separately from the ground up.
