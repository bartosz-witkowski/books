a) observed <- observe,          | inflection past tense of the same verb
b) observation <- observe        | derivation as it it's a different part of speech 
c) dogs <- dog                   | inflection if it refers plural of the same word, derivation if we're talking about the verb "dog" (as in "he was dogging me for some time now")
d) «high school» <- high, school | derivation, obviously, as we create a new form from two old ones
