Polish
 * nouns are inflected for number like in English but pluralization rules are more complex and irregular e.g kot, koty [cat, cats], mysz, myszy [mouse, mice] but pies, psy [dog, dogs], oko, oczy [eye, eyes].
 * nouns have 7 cases compared to two of English and follow fairly regular declension rules
 * adjectives 
  * have to agree with with the noun 
  * comperative for short adjectives is formed by adding a -szy or -iejszy stem and the superlative by adding a naj- prefix to the comparative with some exceptions or omissions e.g tani, tańszy, najtańszy [cheap, cheaper, cheapest]; drogi, droższy, najdroższy [expensive, more expensive, most expensive]
    * exceptions: dobry, lepszy, najlepszy [good, better, best], zły, gorszy, najgorszy [bad, worse, worst]
  * for longer adjectives it's formed by adding "bardziej" [more] for the comperative and "najbardziej" [most] to the adjective i.e inteligentny, bardziej inteligentny, najbardziej inteligentny [intelligent, more intelligent, most intelligent] 
 * adverbs are formed by adding a -ie or -o suffix e.g drogo [expensively], tanio [cheaply], ładnie [prettily]
