\section{Completness}

Let $X, Y \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $X \le Y$

If $Y = 0$ then because \texttt{natural\_number} is complete there exists a proof
tree which can be extended to for \texttt{0 $\le$ Y}.

Otherwise 
$X$ equals $s^n(0)$ for some $n$, $Y$ equals $s^m(0)$ for some $m, m \ge n$. We can write
a proof tree:

\[
\begin{aligned}
   s^n(0)    & \le s^m(0) \\
   s^{n-1}(0) & \le s^{m-1}(0) \\
   & \ldots \\
   0          & \le s^{m-n}(0) \\
\end{aligned}
\]
\[
\texttt{natural\_number}(s^{m-n}(0)) 
\]

\section{Correctness}

Proof by induction on X. Suppose that $\le$ is deducible from program $3.2$ in
$n$ steps. If $n = 0$ the goal is proved - because we know that
\texttt{natural\_number} is correct and $0 \le Y$ is the indented meaning of
program $3.2$.

For $n > 0$ the proof must be in the form:
\[
   s(X') \le s(Y')
\]
and $X' \le Y'$ is deducible in $n - 1$ steps. By the induction hypothesis
program $3.2$ is correct.
